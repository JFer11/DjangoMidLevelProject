# Welcome humble traveler 

The goal of this project was simply to learn Django.
Many functionalities were added throughout the commits.

### To run the project:
1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Install the requirements.
3. Set up an .env file next to .env.example (follow the instructions in the .env.example file)
4. In the "buisinessweb" directory, run: "python manage.py runserver"
5. Enjoy a great website with dynamic content, an admin page with multiple levels of user permissions to manage the content of that website, some mail features, and much more.

Comments or suggestions are welcome. :)

Note:
Backend language: English.
Frontend language: Spanish.
